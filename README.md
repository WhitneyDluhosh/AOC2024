Advent of Code 2024

Have some fun learn go!
Some important commands

`go mod init file` 

The command above creates a new go.mod file

`go mod tidy`

This adds a new module if you've updated your imports to install a particular package and will generate your go.sum file and install the modules you need

`go run .`

The most important! this runs the go file in your current directory
